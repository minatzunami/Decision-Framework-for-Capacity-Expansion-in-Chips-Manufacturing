# Decision Framework for Capacity Expansion in Chips Manufacturing
## Overview
This repository contains a group project developed for a **case competition** focused on strategic decision-making in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. The project evaluates alternative approaches to capacity expansion and proposes a structured framework to support investment decisions.

Specifically, the project compares **Fab Expansion** and **Fab Construction** as two possible strategies for increasing chip manufacturing capacity.

---

## Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to determine the more suitable capacity expansion strategy by combining:
- **Quantitative cost-based analysis**, and
- **Qualitative strategic evaluation**

By integrating both perspectives, the project aims to provide a comprehensive and well-justified recommendation.

## Project Structure

### Part I: Quantitative Cost Analysis
The first part of the project focuses on numerical evaluation using data provided in the case materials.

Key elements include:
- Cost comparison between Fab Expansion and Fab Construction
- Financial reasoning based on the given assumptions and parameters
- Objective evaluation of which option is more cost-efficient under the case constraints

This section provides the **quantitative foundation** for the final recommendation.

---

### Part II: Qualitative Strategic Analysis
The second part of the project complements the numerical results with qualitative insights derived from external research.

This analysis considers:
- Break-even Analysis
- Demand Projection Forecast

The qualitative discussion helps assess factors that are not fully captured by cost figures alone.

---

## Decision Framework
The final recommendation is based on a **combined decision framework**, where:
- Quantitative results establish financial feasibility, and
- Qualitative insights provide strategic justification

This integrated approach ensures that the chosen option is both economically sound and strategically robust.


## Notes
This repository is intended for academic and competition purposes. All analyses are based on case-provided data and publicly available sources.
